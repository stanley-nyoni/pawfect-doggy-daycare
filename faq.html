            <span class="question">
                Can i bring my dog's favorite toy to daycare?
            </span>
            <span class="answer">
                We provide toys, and ask that you not bring your dog's own. It's just too much to ask any dog to share his favorite toy. (If your dog is boarding with us, however, you may bring a few comfort items which will be kept in his private suite.)
            </span>
        </div>
        <div class="single-question">
            <span class="question">
                Do you have a small dog area?
            </span>
            <span class="answer">
                Pawfect customizes play areas to meet the needs of our clients. We have a separate indoor play area for small dogs. If you have a small dog who prefers to play with the big dogs, we will certainly discuss this with you and place your dog in the area best suited for him. </span>
        </div>
        <div class="single-question">
            <span class="question">Are the dogs supervised at all times during off-leash play? </span>
            <span class="answer">Absolutely</span>
        </div>
        <div class="single-question">
            <span class="question">Can i see the facility where my doy will be staying?</span>
            <span class="answer">Of course. We encourage you to visit and tour the facility before enrolling. </span>
        </div>
        <div class="single-question">
            <span class="question">Do you walk the dogs?</span>
            <span class="answer">No. Since the dogs are out playing all day, there is no need to walk a dog for exercise. </span>
        </div>
        <div class="single-question">
            <span class="question">Do dogs ever get hurt?</span>
            <span class="answer">We do our best to minimize any injury to your dog. During normal play, a dog may get small scratches, nicks, and lose small patches of fur. Although rare, it is possible for more serious injuries to occur. </span>
        </div>
        <div class="single-question">
            <span class="question">It seems like a 'ZOO' when i drop my dog off. Is it like that all day?</span>
            <span class="answer">No. When we have visitors, such as a new dog or new person, the dogs often get very excited and you can hear and see this excitement. There is always playing and some barking going on, but the dogs actually settle down quite a bit once the new dog is introduced into the play areas and our human visitors either leave or are very quiet for a few minutes. </span>
        </div>
        <div class="single-question">
            <span class="question">Why do you require that my dog be spayed or neutered?</span>
            <span class="answer">The main reason is that intact dogs are at greater risk of injury from other dogs. In a social environment, intact males are often viewed as threats by other dominant dogs. Intact females, whether in heat or not, may be picked on by other female dogs and male dogs will view her as an intact female and treat her as such. </span>
        </div>
        <div class="single-question">
            <span class="question">What is a dog daycare?</span>
            <span class="answer">A dog daycare is an environment where dogs are dropped off for the day to play and interact with other dogs in a fun, well-supervised, clean, safe environment. </span>
        </div>
        <div class="single-question">
            <span class="question">How often is your facility cleaned?</span>
            <span class="answer">We clean and disinfect daily, regardless of how many dogs have visited. Toys are given anti-bacterial baths daily as well. Blankets, beds, and cots are always kept clean. </span>
